# Medical Delivery Drone Simulation

A Python-based simulation for evaluating autonomous drone navigation in medical supply delivery, using neuro-evolution and genetic algorithms for obstacle avoidance and route optimization.

## Overview

This project simulates a drone navigating through obstacles to deliver medical supplies. The simulation uses a genetic algorithm to evolve the drone’s decision-making over generations, optimizing for efficiency and obstacle avoidance.

## Features

- **Autonomous Obstacle Avoidance:** Drones learn to navigate through environmental obstacles using neuro-evolution.
- **Genetic Algorithm:** Optimizes drone behavior over generations.
- **Real-World Constraints:** Models battery life, terrain, weather, and regulatory restrictions.
- **Visual Simulation:** Built with Pygame for interactive visualization.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pygame**
- **NumPy**

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medical-delivery-drone-simulation.git
